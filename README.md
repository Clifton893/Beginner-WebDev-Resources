# Beginner-WebDev-Resources
In September 2019, I made the decision to teach myself how to code. I wanted to compile a list of the resources that personally helped me along the way, so that maybe they will help other people beginning to code.

If you want to learn to code for free, or are new to how the web works, hopefully this repo will help you!

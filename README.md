# Beginner Web Developer Resources
In September 2019, I made the decision to teach myself how to code. I wanted to share all the great resources that have helped me along the way, for other people starting out. Best of all, except for one Udemy course, these are all free!

## BONUS: Premium Content
The goal of this repo--and my self-study!--was to be as frugal as possible.

That said, [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/)'s *The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp* is by far the best investment I've made in my education. I found her course during one of those $15 sales, and it made a huge difference. Angela is a tremendous teacher, especially for visual learners. She did the nearly-impossible, and make me actually enjoy working with JavaScript.

This course completely revamped my code journey. If you spot it during one of Udemy's big sales, I highly recommend you get it. It's well-worth the investment.
